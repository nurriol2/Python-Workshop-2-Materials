What do you want to do?

I want to have everyone start by getting a short jupyter notebook up on their machines
I want them to read it
	I want the notebook to explain what we will cover
	I want one example where the students have to explain what they think a program does
	I want the notebook to direct them on how to open spyder on their machines

I want everyone to open the included .py file with the day's exercise
	(make several files to they get practice using tabs in spyder?)
	I want the students to edit the bad-format code and run it in spyder	
	

What do you want the students to do in spyder?
	I want them to analyze examples of bad programs (see above)
	I want them to make suggestions about how to improve the bad examples
	I want them to implement their suggestions into their own code (see above)
		you will need to show them how to make a new script in spyder
	I want them to write their own code by following along with correctly formatted comments that contain instructions

what topics do you want to cover?
	Dictionaries
		.keys()
		.values()
		.items()
		.setdefault()
			include the pre-code THEN introduce this
		dict[key] = value
		**DNA problem
	"many" user defined functions
		functions that implement formulas
