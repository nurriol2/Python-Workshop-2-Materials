    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's workshop, we'll be covering the most common ways to combine different pieces of data in Python and how to read and write files. When programming, you'll often find you have a collection of related items like a collection of numbers describing the position of a particle over time or a collection of words making up a sentence. Because this occurs a lot, Python comes with datatypes for very general but useful ways you might want to aggregate data. However, sometimes you need to do more specific work like matrix algebra or numerics, and for this a Python library called NumPy exists that is less generic but much better suited for expressing math and doing computations quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python objects though only live as long as your program is running. And even if you kept your programs running forever, they might crash or your battery might die or the power might go out. To get around this, you'll need to read data in from files and write to files so we'll cover that too.\n",
