# Python-Workshop-2
This repository contains instructional materials for the second installment of Python-Workshop created by N. Sherer.

It is assumed that the student has already attended and understood the content of workshop 1 or is at least familiar 
with the following topics:

1. jupyter notebooks
2. installing Anaconda 
3. importing libraries
4. importing files (.csv)
5. basic operators
6. the matlibplot.pyplot library
7. the range() built-in function
8. writing user defined functions
9. keyword arguments
10. for loops

*The following are instructions for this repository and an outline for the workshop is presented.*

# Instructions
For every problem of the outline, problem names have been fully capitalized
and the intended methods for solving the problem are noted directly after 
problem name using a hyphen: "-". Another hyphen immediately follows and 
a short description of the problem is given.

The files associated with that problem are given with their extensions one line 
and four spaces (one TAB) below. 

It is expected that there are 2 versions of every file. 
1. Containing answers; indicated by 'solutions' in filename
2. Containing only the problem statement; indicated by 'exercise' in filename

For every section of the outline where it is expected the student read some instructions/information
presented, the word READ is presented followed by a hyphen and a description of main information that
is being read. 
The associated files are also given with their extensions one line and four 
spaces (one TAB) below.
